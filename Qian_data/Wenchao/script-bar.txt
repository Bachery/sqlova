This image shows the global sales of three top-selling mobile phone brands in the last five years.
In 2013, the sales of X company reached 450 million, which were almost three times as much as the sales of Y Company.
Even in the worst year, the sales of X Company still remained above 300 million.
But after 2015, the sales of Y Company were basically stable between 200 million and 250 million.
The scales of Z Company in 2017 were almost as good as the sales of Y Company in 2013.
